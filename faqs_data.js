    question: 'How do you create a WishYoo Card?',
    answer: 'You can create a WishYoo Card in a few simple steps. Complete them all or skip a few…the choice is up to you.<br><br>The first step is the voice. The creator of the card sings a song or starts a chant. When your friends go to join your card, they’ll hear your original recording and add their voices to the mix. As more people join, the chant grows into one massive chorus.<br><br>The next step is to write a nice dedication for recipient. Our app allows you to hand write with a finger or stylus on your mobile device so that your dedication looks just as beautiful as it would on the fanciest card stock. Along with your written message, feel free to add pictures of the great times you’ve shared. When people join your card, they’ll compose their own dedication, and paste it on the board somewhere close to yours. Best of all, the board grows as more people join.<br><br>And finally, you can set up a special crowd-funded gift for the recipient. Our app allows you to organize all the details. Describe the gift, add a photo, and tell people how they can chip in. People who join the card can pledge to contribute a certain amount to the overall purchase. You can track the progress of the fund raising directly on the app, but you are ultimately responsible for collecting the money and making the final purchase on your own.<br><br>When all your friends have joined, you can send the WishYoo Card to your lucky loved one with just one tap on your screen.',

You can invite the entire world to sign the WishYoo Card you send to your friend on his graduation. Try doing that with an e-card or paper card.',
